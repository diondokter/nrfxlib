# nrfxlib

> Rust nrfxlib wrapper for the nRF9160

This crate is published by [42 Technology Ltd](https://www.42technology.com).

## Introduction

This crate provides a Socket API for embedded applications running on the
Nordic nRF9160.

Access to the LTE baseband on the nRF9160 is currently only available using
Nordic's closed-source binary blob - a static library called `libbsd.a`, which
lives in a public Nordic git repo called `nrfxlib` along with a few other bits
and pieces (see https://github.com/NordicPlayground/nrfxlib).

That library provides a Berkeley-ish socket API, with some extensions to the
usual socket types so that you can open an AT socket to talk AT commands to the
baseband, and a GNSS socket so you can read GPS data.

## Getting the static library

We use a crate called `nrfxlib-sys` to link to the library. This crate includes
Nordic's header files and static library as a git sub-module (from their [Github
page](https://github.com/NordicPlayground/nrfxlib)) and runs [`bindgen`] to
generate Rust 'headers' which correspond to the functions and constants in the
relevant header files. You no longer need to install `bindgen` - it gets pulled
in as a crate - but you do need to use Rust 1.51 or higher.

[`bindgen`]: https://crates.io/crates/bindgen

## Using this wrapper

The basic premise is that this crate calls out to Nordic's library to do all
the work, and it just presents some simple types to the user (which hopefully
reduce the likelihood of the user getting something seriously wrong).

For example, Nordic's library uses standard C integers for their socket file
descriptors. We have wrapped these up in a `Socket` struct, ensuring that
`nrf_socket_close` is called when the `Socket` object is dropped. You can also
no longer pass arbitrary integers to the `read` and `write` functions, and
instead you call methods on the `Socket` type.

We have further specialised the `Socket` into `TlsSocket`, `AtSocket`,
`GnssSocket` and `TcpSocket`, each with their own factory functions and
special methods. Support for UDP datagrams and other sorts of sockets is TBD -
pull requests are welcome!

If you want to make a TLS connection, you need to first push the certificates
and keys into a special area of flash controlled by the Nordic library. You
can do this with the `provision_certificates` function. Each certificate or
key is given a unique integer tag (by you), and you pass these tags when you
create the `TlsSocket` so the stack knows which certificates you want to use.
You at least need to supply a root certificate to be used for verifying the
server-side certificate. You can optionally also supply a client-side
certificate and private key, for performing client authentication.

## What Currently Works

* Opening plain TCP connections, including DNS lookups of host-names
* Opening TLS connections, with and without client-side certificates
* Opening an AT socket, sending AT commands and receiving responses
* Opening a GNSS socket and getting a GNSS fix
* Polling on sockets
* Configuring the chip for LTE-M, NB-IoT and/or GNSS mode.

## Example

See [nrf9160-demo](https://github.com/42-technology-ltd/nrf9160-demo) for a demo application that uses this library.

## Changelog

### Unreleased Changes ([Source](https://github.com/42-technology-ltd/nrfxlib/tree/develop) | [Changes](https://github.com/42-technology-ltd/nrfxlib/compare/v0.6.1...develop))

* None

### v0.6.1 ([Source](https://github.com/42-technology-ltd/nrfxlib/tree/v0.6.1) | [Changes](https://github.com/42-technology-ltd/nrfxlib/compare/v0.6.0...v0.6.1))

* Fixed a memory ownership issue in `nrf_modem_init`. The `nrf_modem_init_params` pointer given to the init must
  have a static lifetime. This has been a stack variable since forever.  
  Originally this seems to have not been required, but this changed +-4 years ago
  without documentation update from Nordic.

### v0.6.0 ([Source](https://github.com/42-technology-ltd/nrfxlib/tree/v0.6.0) | [Changes](https://github.com/42-technology-ltd/nrfxlib/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.0))

* Updated to nrfxlib-sys v1.5.1.
  * Requires Rust v1.51 as we use the new resolver to allow bindgen as a build-dep
  * Rename FFI exports from `bsd_X` to `nrf_modem_X`
  * Implement IPC functionality
  * Implement library and transmit heaps
  * Supply hard-float libraries by default. The nRF9160 has an FPU so we might as well use the VFP registers.
* Update to latest heapless - no more `heapless::consts::Uxx`

### v0.5.0 ([Source](https://github.com/42-technology-ltd/nrfxlib/tree/v0.5.0) | [Changes](https://github.com/42-technology-ltd/nrfxlib/compare/v0.4.0...v0.5.0))

* Updated to nrfxlib version 1.2.0
* Certificates now handled through AT commands.

### v0.4.0 ([Source](https://github.com/42-technology-ltd/nrfxlib/tree/v0.4.0) | [Changes](https://github.com/42-technology-ltd/nrfxlib/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.0))

* Add TLS v1.3 and DTLS v1.2 support

### v0.3.0 ([Source](https://github.com/42-technology-ltd/nrfxlib/tree/v0.3.0) | [Changes](https://github.com/42-technology-ltd/nrfxlib/compare/v0.2.2...v0.3.0))

* Derive `clone` for `Error`.
* Update to latest `nrxflib-sys` crate.
* Update wrappers for updated GPS API.

### v0.2.2 ([Source](https://github.com/42-technology-ltd/nrfxlib/tree/v0.2.2) | [Changes](https://github.com/42-technology-ltd/nrfxlib/compare/v0.2.1...v0.2.2))

* Fixed changelog in README.

### v0.2.1 ([Source](https://github.com/42-technology-ltd/nrfxlib/tree/v0.2.1) | [Changes](https://github.com/42-technology-ltd/nrfxlib/compare/v0.2.0...v0.2.1))

* Change PollEntry so it holds a const-reference rather than a mutable-reference to the socket.
* Use latest nrfxlib-sys crate.

### v0.2.0 ([Source](https://github.com/42-technology-ltd/nrfxlib/tree/v0.2.0) | [Changes](https://github.com/42-technology-ltd/nrfxlib/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0))

* Changed `modem::start()` to `modem::on()` and removed called to AT+COPS=0.
* Add wrapper for `nrf_poll` to pend on multiple sockets at once.
* Added `GnssSocket::get_blocking_fix()`
* Added API to get/set the System Mode.
* Added 'use_case' socket option for GPS.
* Use git version of `nrfxlib-sys` which has a cargo-5730 workaround.

### v0.1.0 ([Source](https://github.com/42-technology-ltd/nrfxlib/tree/v0.1.0))

First release.
